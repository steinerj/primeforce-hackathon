# primeforce-hackathon
A collective repo for the primeforce hackathon - Spring &amp; Angular/NativeScript

To run the backend:
java -jar sth-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

It will run on localhost:8080 and there you can find the list of API endpoints. Thereâ€™s one additional endpoint http:localhost:8080/login that is not on the list.

You can use https://ngrok.com/ to tunnel to your locally running server.

NB: The backend requires Java 12
